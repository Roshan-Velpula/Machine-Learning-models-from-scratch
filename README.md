# Machine-Learning-models-from-scratch
This repository contains my implementations of popular machine learning algorithms from scratch, as a part of my data science learning journey. By implementing these algorithms myself, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

**Algorithms Implemented**.\
So far, I have implemented the following algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
